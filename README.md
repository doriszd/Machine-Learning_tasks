4 tasks for Machine Learning and Statistics 2020


## Task 1: Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places.

In order to complete the task I will do the following:

1. Research the topic by repeated watching the lecture video and find more information online.
2. Based on information that I find I will write a python function that calculates square root of 2 and use Pyhton to set the output to 100 decimal places without using any libraries.
3. Test my function using Python library.
4. Write conclusion and references.


The square root of 2 or root 2 is represented using the square root symbol √ and written as √2 whose value is 1.414. I will use Newton's method to find the root of 2. 
The method comprises of 4 steps: 

1. Take a reasonable guess (approximate root) for the square root.
2. Add the approximate root with the original number divided by the approximate root and divide by 2.
x_i := (x_i + n / x_i) / 2
3. Continue step 2 until the difference in the approximate root along the iterations is less than the desired value (or precision value).
4. The approximate root is the square root we want.
