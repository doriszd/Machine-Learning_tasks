    "The square root of 2 or root 2 is represented using the square root symbol √ and written as √2 whose value is 1.414. This value is widely used in mathematics. Root 2 is an irrational number as it cannot be expressed as a fraction and has an infinite number of decimals. So, the exact value of the root of 2 cannot be determined. The square root of 2 is the number which when multiplied with itself gives the result as 2. It is generally represented as √2 or 2½. At present, the root 2 value is computed to 10 trillion digits. For general use, its value is truncated and is used as 1.414 to make calculations easy. \n",

    "To find the square root value of a number, we usually check if the number is a perfect square or not. It is easy to find the root of perfect squares, but for non-perfect squares, we have to use the long division method to find the root value. Numbers like 2, 3, 5, 20, etc. are non-perfect squares, but 4, 9, 25, etc. are perfect squares, which gives the whole number when we take the root of them.\n",

    "Step 1: In this method, you have to make an estimate first, means you have chosen a close number by finding at-least two roots which are perfect. It has been those root that your number is between those values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Then, you can divide the number by one of those square roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Once you start and continue with the division process, you will need to take the average of the result of step 2 and the root. And finally, you can use the result that you get in step 3 to repeat the 2nd and 3rd step until you get a number that is satisfactory or accurate enough for you. https://byjus.com/maths/square-root-of-2/"
