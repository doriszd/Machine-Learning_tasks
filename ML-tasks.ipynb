    "The square root of 2 or root 2 is represented using the square root symbol √ and written as √2 whose value is 1.414. This value is widely used in mathematics. It is an irrational number as it cannot be expressed as a fraction and has an infinite number of decimals. So, the exact value of the root of 2 cannot be determined. The square root of 2 is the number which when multiplied with itself gives the result as 2. The root 2 value can be computed to 10 trillion digits. For general use, its value is truncated and is used as 1.414 to make calculations easy. \n",

    "To find the square root value of a number, we usually check if the number is a perfect square or not. It is easy to find the root of perfect squares, but for non-perfect squares, we have to use the long division method to find the root value. Numbers like 2, 3, 5, 20, etc. are non-perfect squares, but 4, 9, 25, etc. are perfect squares, which gives the whole number when we take the root of them (byjus.com).\n",

    "In numerical analysis, Newton's method, also known as the Newton–Raphson method, named after Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson, is a root-finding algorithm which produces successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. The root of a function is the point at which f(x)=0. Many equations have more than one root. Every real polynomial of odd degree has an odd number of real roots. Newton-Raphson is an iterative method that begins with an initial guess of the root. The method uses the derivative of the function f′(x) as well as the original function f(x), and thus only works when the derivative can be determined (aaronschlegel.me)\n",

The variable r is equal to x and used as the guess of starting square root which means that r would be eqal to 2. This part will be changed in my Pyhton code because I will set guess variable to 1 as a reasonable guess or approximate root. As there is no best initial guess according to computingskillset.com I will set my guess variable to 1. After the guess we move to next step and set the precision. Next step is to loop the root as long as it is higher than precision and it has to be divided by 2. \n",

    "After doing all these tests on root 2 I have realized why this topic is interesting for research. I will be going back at what I have written at the beginning of the project when I was trying to explain the importance of root 2. It says that \"the exact value of the root of 2 cannot be determined\" and even if I didn't take that information seriously at first, now after four different testings I can confirm the same as I got 4 different results. What matters most is that all results output what we call root of 2, and that is a float number 1.414, therefore we can say that all four algorithms have been sucessful. The most precise one was algorithm using decimal module as it is the only one that does not end with numerous zeros. It is not repetitive as other results. The reason might be the number of decimal points. As the number of decimal points increases the algorithm is not able to produce the precise result so it outputs zeros instead. What is interesting about this project is even though decimal module gave us \"correct\" results, without outputting zeros, we still can't be sure if that is the correct answer as the exact value of root of 2 cannot be precisely determined.

Crosstabulation presents the distributions of two categorical variables simultaneously, with the intersections of the categories of the variables appearing in the cells of the table.  The Test of Independence assesses whether an association exists between the two variables by comparing the observed pattern of responses in the cells to the pattern that would be expected if the variables were truly independent of each other.

    "The aim of this task is to verify Chi sqared value using scipy.stats and calculate p-value. Data that I have got shows the same Chi sqared value as the one that is shown in the given example on wikipedia page. In both cases Chi square is 24.6. To be more precise I got the result of 24.57120 with p-value of 0.00041. P-value tells us if we need to reject null hypothesis or not. Null hypothesis is an assumption that there is no relationship between variables. In this case four different neighbourhoods (A, B, C, D) were tested to see if there is any connection between neighbourhoods and person's occupational profession (white collar, blue collar, no collar). As p-value is 0.00041 it tells us that we need to reject null hypothesis (H0) which means that there is significant relationship between the neighbourhood and the occupation of people who live there. In order to show significant difference between the variables p-value should be less than 0.05 if probability is defined in 95%. \n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, Chi sqared test is extremely important in hypothesis testing. In order to get accurate results aims, null hypothesis and problems of the research should be clearly defined before the actual testing. It is a great starting method in a research since it shows if there is any statistical difference between the variables and gives us valuable insight into the core of the problems. From my point of view, Chi sqared test should be done when we have done our research of the topic and if the test shows there is significant difference between tested variables, we shouldn't stop there, we should keep researching and asking more questions in order to find out what the real problems are. Numbers that we get using Chi sqared test don't really mean much without understanding the causes and consequences of the problems or variables that we are testing. \n",
