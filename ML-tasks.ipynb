    "The square root of 2 or root 2 is represented using the square root symbol √ and written as √2 whose value is 1.414. This value is widely used in mathematics. It is an irrational number as it cannot be expressed as a fraction and has an infinite number of decimals. So, the exact value of the root of 2 cannot be determined. The square root of 2 is the number which when multiplied with itself gives the result as 2. The root 2 value can be computed to 10 trillion digits. For general use, its value is truncated and is used as 1.414 to make calculations easy. \n",

    "\n",
    "To find the square root value of a number, we usually check if the number is a perfect square or not. It is easy to find the root of perfect squares, but for non-perfect squares, we have to use the long division method to find the root value. Numbers like 2, 3, 5, 20, etc. are non-perfect squares, but 4, 9, 25, etc. are perfect squares, which gives the whole number when we take the root of them.\n",

    "In numerical analysis, Newton's method, also known as the Newton–Raphson method, named after Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson, is a root-finding algorithm which produces successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. The root of a function is the point at which f(x)=0. Many equations have more than one root. Every real polynomial of odd degree has an odd number of real roots. Newton-Raphson is an iterative method that begins with an initial guess of the root. The method uses the derivative of the function f′(x) as well as the original function f(x), and thus only works when the derivative can be determined.https://aaronschlegel.me/newtons-method-equation-roots.html\n",

    "2. Add the approximate root with the original number divided by the approximate root and divide by 2.\n",
    "x_i := (x_i + n / x_i) / 2\n",
    "3. Continue step 2 until the difference in the approximate root along the iterations is less than the desired value (or precision value).\n",
    "4. The approximate root is the square root we want.\n",

    "My Python code is based on the algorithm below. The algorithm was taken from the above mentioned web page and there will be some adjustments done in order to complete the task as necessary. Firstly, function is defined as mySqrt and x is a number that we want to find the root of. In this case x will be 2. The variable r is equal to x and used as the guess of starting square root which means that r would be eqal to 2. This part will be changed in my Pyhton code because I will set guess variable to 1 as a reasonable guess or approximate root. As there is no best initial guess according to https://computingskillset.com/solving-equations/how-to-find-the-initial-guess-in-newtons-method/ I will set my guess variable to 1. After the guess we move to next step and set the precision. Next step is to loop the root as long as it is higher than precision and it has to be divided by 2. \n",
